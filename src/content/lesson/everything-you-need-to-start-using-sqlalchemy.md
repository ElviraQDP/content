## What is SQL Alchemy

SQL Alchemy is an [Object-Relational Mapper / Mapping-tool](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-relational_mapping), or ORM: a library that developers use to create databases and manipulate their data without the need of knowing/using SQL.

There are other alternatives to it like SQLAlchemy like Peewee, and other languages have their own ORM's like PHP Eloquent or Java Hibernate.

## Why Use ORM?

ORM's have gained popularity because dealing with SQL language directly requires a lot of effort in many cases. The goal of any ORM is to simplify the maintenance of your data. This is done by creating ***objects*** to deal with database interactions.

With ORM you won't have to type SQL again (95% of the time) and you will be able to work with objects.

### Example:

To insert an user with SQL you have to type:

```sql
INSERT INTO user (name, last_name) VALUES ('Bob', 'Ross');
```

With an ORM your code keeps being familiar like this:

```py
user = User()
user.name = 'Bob'
user.last_name = 'Ross'

db.session.commit()
```
You can just say: `db.session.commit()` and all the things you have done in your code will be translated into SQL language code.

## Let's review the most typical database operation

## Creating our database


The first step will be defining our model

```py
class Person(Base):
    __tablename__ = 'person'
    # Here we define columns for the table person
    # Notice that each column is also a normal Python instance attribute.
    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True)
    name = Column(String(250), nullable=False)


    def serialize(self):
        return {
            "id": self.id,
            "name": self.name
        }
  ```

### INSERT: Inserting a Database Record

All you have to do is create a new Person object, add it into the database session and commit!
Just replace `<username_value>` and `<email_value>` with the real values you want added below.

```py
person = Person(username=<username_value>, email=<email_value>)
db.session.add(person)
db.session.commit()
```

### SELECT: Fetching / Retrieving Records

There are 3 ways to retrieve data from a database:
    1. Fetch all record from a particular Table/Model using `MyModel.query.all()`
    2. Fetch one single record based on its primary key using `MyModel.query.get(id)`
    3. Fetch a group of records based on a query `Person.query.filter_by(arg1=value, arg2=value, ...)`

```py
# here is how to fetch all people
all_people = Person.query.all()
all_people = list(map(lambda x: x.serialize(), all_people))

# here is how to fetch a group of people with name = alex
all_people = Person.query.filter_by(name='alex')
all_people = list(map(lambda x: x.serialize(), all_people))

# here is how to fetch the person with id=3 (only works with primary keys)
person = Person.query.get(3)
```

### DELETE: Removing a Database Record.

All you have to do is create a new Person object, add it into the database session and commit!

```py
person = Person.query.get(3)
db.session.delete(person)
db.session.commit()
```

### UDPATE: Updating a Record

To update you need first to retrieve/select the record from the database, then you can update whatever property you like and commit again.

```py
person = Person.query.get(3)
person.name = "Bob"
db.session.commit()
```
## Transactions

A transaction is a sequence of operations (like INSERT, UPDATE, SELECT) made on your database, performed as one single work of unit. In other words, a transaction will never be complete unless each individual operation within the group is successful. If any operation within the transaction fails, the entire transaction fails.

Transactions have the following 4 standard properties(known as ACID properties):

![Transactions](../../assets/images/tran-1.png)

A transaction ends with COMMIT or ROLLBACK. 

On a datababase the COMMIT command should be issued, so that changes will take effect. COMMIT works just like on Github (you add every file and modification first  `git add` and then by saying `git commit` you save your changes).

On the other hand, if something goes wrong or a failure occurs, a ROLLBACK command should be issued, to return every table referenced in the transaction to its previous state.
