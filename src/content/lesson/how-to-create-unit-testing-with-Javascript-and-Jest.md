## What is Unit Testing?

It serves to validate the smallest piece of your code called a unit (like a function, method, procedure, module or object) is working properly or as expected. 

The testing is done during the coding phase

## Benefits of using Unit Testing:

+ **you can find and prevent bugs easily** If there is a problem in the future you'll be to identify the cause a lot faster than having to trough all the code. Also your end-user will be very happy not have a buggy product.

+ **Unit Testing saves time....and money** When writing Uni tests you may identify many possible bugs and fix them right away, instead of fixing them in different stages of the product.

+ **Your code is more reliable and reusable** When your code is divided in units or components where each one has their reponsability or function, your code becomes more reliable and it gives you more confidence. 
Since you have already tested you can reuse it: is clean and effcient and you can migrate your and tests to a new project.

+ Good Unit tests serves as **documentation and defines** what your code is suppose to do.

+ **Unit Testing improves teamwork**. Your will able to follow the logic behind your code and coordinate their code accodingly. By reviewing each other's codes teamwork is more agile.
