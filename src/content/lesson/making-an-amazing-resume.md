## Employment History

1. Do not add more than three past work experiences, unless they are really relevant or related to coding.
2. You need software development experience, what if you don't have? 

Start an internship on any company (even for free) because you need to be able to add that into your resum√© to be on a better position when looking:

```
Title: 
Freelance Web Developer at MyCompany Media

Description:
Responsible for designing, coding and modifying React applications and Python APIs from layout/mockups/wireframes to functional and according to a client's specifications. Strive to create visually appealing sites that feature user-friendly design and clear navigation.
```

Note: DO NOT COPY AND PASTE, please customize it, use different words, different technologies and programming languages that you like, you can talk about eCommerce apps, edTech, you can mention particular industries that you like.

If your final project was a game, you can say you are specialized in building games with HTML/CSS/Javascript/Python.
If it was a social network than you are specialized in building "social apps", etc.
If it was a tutoring site, you can say you are focused on edTech.

## Education

If you have a master's degree or bachelor its very good, you can also add the 4Geeks Academy education.

Do not add your other small certificates (if any) in this section, that would be a different `certifications` section of the Resume.

## Certificate

Add any marketing or design certificates (because those are relevant to coding), 
If you are certified on relevant software apps design or business apps like Photoshop, SAP, Microsoft Dynamics, etc.

## Projects 

The projects you publish must be good quality, **do not publish**: A simple todo list, a random card generator, tic-tac-toe, etc. None of that is impressive.

**You can publish**: 

Enhanced versions of some of the projects you built at the academy, for example:

- Starwars Reading List: You can make this a social reading club, everyone has a password and shares they favorites.
- Contact List: Make the contact list a CRM, basically you add a "status" to each contact and then the sale people can change the contact status based on the sale process.
- Todo List: Todos don't need to have just two status: Done or Not done, you can make them have several like: Not doing, Doing, Done, Approved, Rejected, etc. That will make your todo list a project management tool with stages.

Each of your projects must have:
- Live link
- Readme description with screenshots.
- Organized code.

Note: Quality is more important than quantity, just two or three projects in enough if they are really good.

These are the most important most wanted technologies:

```
HTML5/CSS3, Bootstrap, Javascript ECMAScript 2020, Node.js, GIT/Github, Python, Flask, API's, React.js, Flux, SCRUM, SQL, SQLAlchemy, MySQL, Postgress API's
