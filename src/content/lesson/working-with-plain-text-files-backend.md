## Files are the only way to `store` on a computer.

Your entire computer hard drive is comprised of files, is the most low-level way to store information, your computer runs on a `file system` or `file directory` control that how data is stored and retrieved.

Using a backend language you can access the majority of the computer files, and that gives you almost endless power!

## Retrieving data from files

Let's say that you have the bitcoin prices from the last day in a `bitcoin_prices.csv` file with the following format:

<before-after width="400px"
    before="../../assets/images/97f74cd8-acdd-4ce9-aa26-bfd494e9b550bitcoin_price_csv.png" 
    after="../../assets/images/709ff7ce-f7f6-4b16-a172-521fe1787733bitcoing_prices_table.png" 
/>

Basically, every line in the CSV file represents one price, for example:

```python
Currency,Date,Closing Price (USD),24h Open (USD),24h High (USD),24h Low (USD)
BTC,2019-10-29,9455.7246926058,9228.0745024715,9551.7787262272,9125.7784571584
```

You can read the file with any backend programing language and interpret it based on the positions of the values:

```python{numberLines: true}
import csv, json

file = open("bitcoin_prices.csv", "r") 
csv_f = csv.reader(file)

prices = []
for row in csv_f:
  prices.append({
	  "ticker": row[0],
	  "price": row[2]
  })
```

## Saving data into files

Let's say you are running a script that has a variable called `todos` that contains a todo list:

```python
todos = ['make the bed', 'do the laundry', 'finish homework']
```

That variable is being stored in the RAM memory until you decide to save it to a text file or database. The RAM memory is not reliable because your computer could lose power at any moment (turned off).

You can save that variable into a `todos.csv` file with the following python code:

```python{numberLines: true}
todos = ['make the bed', 'do the laundry', 'finish homework']

todos_as_csv = ','.join(todos) # convert the list into a string
file = open('todos.csv', 'w+') # open the file for writing 'w', create if it doesn't exist
file.write(todos_as_csv) # write the content
file.close() # close the file
```

The code above will create or update a `todos.csv` with content similar to this:

```csv
make the bed, do the laundry, finish homework
```

## Different file formats

| Format        | Explanation |
| ------        | ----------- |
| CSV           | Comma `,` separated values, one line for each row or different entity. |
| JSON          | Very similar to Javascript syntax, made especially for developers and the most used format when transmitting information over the internet (HTTP) |
| Yaml or YML   | The easiest format to understand, developers love it because it is fast but it's also very similar to a simple text file, it allows comments and uses indentation instead of commas or braces for delimitation |
| XML           | Very popular in the 90's and still being used in a lot of legacy software |

### Converting from CSV Text to Python Object in memory

```python{numberLines: true}
import csv
file = open("bitcoin_prices.csv", "r") 
file_content = csv.reader(file)
for row in file_content:
    print("First element: " + row[0])
    print("Second element: " + row[1])
    # etc..
```

### Converting from JSON Text to Python Object in memory

```python{numberLines: true}
import json
filePointer = open("bitcoin_prices.json", "r") 
data = json.load(filePointer)
prices = []
for row in data:
    print("First element: " + row["ticker"])
    print("Second element: " + row["date"])
    # etc..
```

### Converting from Yaml Text to Python Object in memory

```python{numberLines: true}
import yml #you have to install pip package pyyaml

filePointer = open("bitcoin_prices.yml", "r") 
data = yaml.load(filePointer)
prices = []
for row in data:
    print("First element: " + row["ticker"])
    print("Second element: " + row["date"])
    # etc..
```

Here is a live demonstration loading all three types of files.
